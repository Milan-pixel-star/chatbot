**Website-Based RAG Chatbot — AI/ML Engineer Assignment
🔍 Project Overview**

This project is a website-based AI chatbot built using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. The chatbot takes a website URL as input, crawls and extracts meaningful text from the page, converts it into embeddings, stores them in a vector database, and then answers user questions strictly based on the website content.

The main goal of this project is to make sure the chatbot only answers using the provided website data and does not use outside knowledge. If the answer is not found in the website content, it returns a fixed fallback response:

**“The answer is not available on the provided website.”**

The system also handles spelling mistakes in user questions and still tries to retrieve the correct information from the website.
